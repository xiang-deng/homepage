*Hi*, I am a fifth year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science & Engineering at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/), advised by Dr. [Huan Sun](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~sun.397/). Previously, I received a B.Eng. in Computer Science from [USTC](https://www.ustc.edu). In the past, I have had the opportunity to intern and work with many wonderful industrial collaborators from [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-processing/people/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) and [Google Research](https://research.google/).

Research
===
My research interests lie in NLP and data mining, with emphasis on knowledge discovery and utilization from heterogeneous sources. The aim is to build AI-powered data systems that can assist with information acquisition and decision making for regular users as well as domain experts in Digital Era. Specifically, I am exploring the following directions:
- **Large-scale pretraining and representation learning** for data from heterogeneous sources, e.g., web texts and tables, knowledge graphs, and databases; both for general and domain-specific applications
- **Building natural language interfaces** (e.g., question answering, semantic parsing, and dialog systems) with varied data and service as backend.
