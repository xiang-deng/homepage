*Hi*, I am a fifth year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science & Engineering at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/), advised by Dr. [Huan Sun](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~sun.397/). Previously, I received a B.Eng. in Computer Science from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu). I also had the opportunity to work with many wonderful industrial collaborators during my internships at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-processing/people/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) and [Google Research](https://research.google/). Currently, I am also a part-time student researcher at Google Research.
